This is a fork by [BuildJet for GitHub Actions](https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions).
It is **fully compatible with the official cache action**, simply replace `actions/cache` with `buildjet/cache`.
Under the hood we simply switch the underlying caching package to our fully compatible `buildjet/cache`. No other changes have been made to this package.

For help migrating to BuildJet's cache, please visit our [migration guide](https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions/docs/guides/migrating-to-buildjet-cache).
For detailed usage instructions, please visit the [official `actions/cache` repository](https://github.com//).
